Ring Topology  -> Sends data only in one direction
    -> You cannot send data to from A to D directly because the needs tbe traverse through the B & C and then it will reach to D(single link to each node with clock wise direction)

Types -> Single Ring, Dual Ring

Dual can be used in WAN networks only not in LAN
It can also occur data collision.
Communication delay



Mesh Topology
No collision
Network is shared
It has multiple routes if can is blocked then other can be used for data communication


Star Topology
Each node is connected to central controller node
No direct link between end nodes the devices can connect to central controller only
It is very scalable
It is the best option for LAN 


Hybrid Topology
Combination of more than one basic topology



Commands

hostname
getmac
ipconfig
ping www.sheridancollege.ca
tracert www.sheridancollege.ca  -> to trace the path of internet packets that is transferred from Computer to destinantion.
